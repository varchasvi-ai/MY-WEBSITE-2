        <p>Reading is one of my favourite hobby. I love reading, whenever I have free time I just take a book and have leisure time with it. It has made me a bookworm in all categories. Sometimes I read fiction, which brings me into another world and at other times I read non-fiction, which tells me about the reality of our world. I find reading very relaxing so it is also one of my ways to loose stress. My favourite author is J.K. Rowling. She is famous for her Harry potter series. She has also released a new book in August,2020 called the Ickabog. </p>

Her eyes are "silvery", "misty", and "protuberant" (the last quality serving to give her a "permanently surprised look").Luna is one of my favorite charecter because she is different from others and always believes in her insincts no matter how many oppse her.</p>

            I have been drawing my entire life, but during high school, took it more seriously at the age of 16 - teaching myself how to digitally draw. I was born in the Southern end of the UK but moved to the USA when I was 9 where I still currently resideI studied Computer Science at school, but during my studies, I began a Youtube channel to showcase my art and give tips, how to's, hacks, and made more relatable artist content I felt was needed more on Youtube.In October of 2016, my Youtube channel took off with my first video to ever hit 100k within the first week. I spent the next 2 years building my channel up from 3,000 subscribers to now over 440,000, as well as an additional 61,000 on Instagram. I have a total of 28,000,000 video views.I am now a full time artist and social media content creator. I specialize mostly in digital painting in my art career, and in my online video career I handle all filming, presenting, and editing myself.I have worked with many brands online including companies like Skillshare, Wix, Art Amino, Michaels, Wacom, Disney, and Audible.
